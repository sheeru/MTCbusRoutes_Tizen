MTCbusRoutes_Tizen
==================

MTC bus routes using tizen sdk

This app shows Chennai's(India) town bus routes.
It works offline!!!! 

Just enter from where do you want to board and where do you want to get down!!!! It shows all possible routes :)))

The old search results will be hidden when new search is initiated unless cleared, thereby allowing you to check for multiple routes. You can expand the old search results.

When from and to field are same, you get the buses which stop at that particular station.
chennai_bus_routes.txt contains all the necessary bus information for Chennai only. To make this app work for other cities, you can replace this text file with that city's route map.
